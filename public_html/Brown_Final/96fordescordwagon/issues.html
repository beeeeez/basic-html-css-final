<h2>- Same Sex Marriage -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>“Marriage is a sacred institution and allowing same-sex marriage is an abomination to this institution. We, as a people, are drifting away from God whenever we turn a blind-eye on these lawless unions.”</p></div>
</div>

<div id="abortion">
<h2>- Abortion Laws -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>“Those whack-job liberals are trying legalize the murder of unborn- babies. We need to defund Planned Parenthood if the next generation is going to grow up with any morals at all."</p></div>
</div>

<div id="illegals">
<h2>- Illegal Immigration -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>“Pablo(s) and Muhammed(s) have been slipping into our country illegally and taking hard-earned money away from the American people. I want to ask: What about the average Joe? How is he going to feed his American family when the illegals sneak in and take all of our hard-earned jobs?”</p></div>
</div>

<div id="drugs">
<h2>- The War on Drugs -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>"Drug dealers, rapists, and murderers are starting to win the battles in the streets in this war against drugs. We need to double-down. We need to bring fury and justice to them. We need more cops, high-tech police equipment, and better guns to win this critical battle for today’s youth.”</p></div>
</div>

<div id="climate">
<h2>- Climate Change -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>“When President Trump says that climate change is a vicious hoax to combat the capitalistic values of our great nation, I back him one-hundred and ten percent. There is absolutely no data that indicates that we are responsible for any change in the climate.”</p></div>
</div>

<div id="education">
<h2>- Education Reform -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>“We need to bring God back into schools. Big government and the liberals have successfully kept God out of the classroom in public schools. That’s why I implore every U.S. citizen that has a brain to send their children to a private school. As a good parent, you’d be giving your child a fighting chance for heaven in this crazy godless world the liberals have built around them.”</p></div>
</div>

<div id="guns">
<h2>- Gun Control -</h2><div class="hidden">
<p>“The Second Amendment ensures that every U.S. citizen has the right to protect themselves, especially from the foreigners who come from abroad to tear down our great nation. Guns and police are the two barriers preventing criminals from breaking into our houses, tying up our families, and taking God out of our country.”</p></div>
